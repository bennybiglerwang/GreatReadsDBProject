# GreatReadsDBProject
Great Reads the better Good Reads

For our project, we want to design a platform that allows users to access a database of books in addition to their reviews. We found a book dataset on kaggle that has a desirable amount of information needed to complete this project. Attributes of the database would include the book’s title, author, year of publication, genre, rating, and reviews. Users of the platform will be able to upload their own reviews and ratings (using a 5-star system) as well as view other users’ reviews and ratings. The target users of our system would be people who enjoy reading and reviewing books (and are looking for other opinions on books they are interested in). Our main three functionalities would be 1) searching books based on their attributes, such as the title, author, or genre (and seeing average ratings and top reviews) 2) posting reviews and rating books, and 3) organizing books into personal lists (read, to-read, currently-reading).
